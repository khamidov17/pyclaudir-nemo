"""File-backed read-only store for inbound Telegram attachments.

Scoped strictly to ``data/attachments/``. Path resolution mirrors
:class:`pyclaudir.storage.memory.MemoryStore` — same traversal-hardened rules
(no ``..``, no absolute paths outside the root, no symlinks). The dispatcher
in :mod:`pyclaudir.telegram_io` is the *only* writer; the model only ever
reads through :class:`AttachmentStore`.

Returned content depends on the file kind:

- text-like (md/txt/log/csv/json/yaml/...): UTF-8 string, capped.
- image (jpg/png/webp/gif): raw bytes + mime, for the caller to wrap as
  an MCP image content block.
- pdf: extracted text per page via ``pypdf``, joined with page markers,
  capped at the same byte budget as text-like files.

Anything else is rejected at the kind-detection step so an attacker who
manages to write into the attachments directory by hand can't trick the
model into reading an arbitrary binary blob through this surface.
