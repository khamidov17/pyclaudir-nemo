"""File-backed memory under ``data/memories/``.

Path resolution is **path-traversal hardened** — any of the following must
raise :class:`MemoryPathError`:

- a component containing ``..``
- an absolute path
- a path whose canonical resolution leaves the memories root
- a path whose resolution traverses any symlink

These rules apply to **both reads and writes** and are tested in
``tests/test_memory_path_safety.py``.

Writes are guarded by the **read-before-write invariant** (Claudir Part 3):
before overwriting or appending to an existing file you must first read it
in this process. This stops the model from blindly destroying operator-
curated notes whose content it never observed. Creating a new file (one
that doesn't yet exist) is always allowed because there's nothing to lose.
The "read paths" set lives in this instance and resets on process restart.
