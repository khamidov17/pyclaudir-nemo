"""``read_attachment`` — read a Telegram attachment by relative path.

Companion to the dispatcher's attachment ingest in ``telegram_io.py``. Path
resolution is locked to ``data/attachments/``: same traversal-hardened
rules as ``read_memory`` (no ``..``, no absolute paths, no symlinks). The
absolute paths the dispatcher writes into ``[attachment: ...]`` markers
land *under* the attachments root, so the model passes the relative tail
back into this tool — or it hands the absolute path and we strip the root.
