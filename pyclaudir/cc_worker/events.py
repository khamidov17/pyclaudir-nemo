"""Per-turn event types produced by the CC worker.

:class:`TurnResult` is the structured handoff between worker and engine:
the worker assembles one as it parses stdout events from Claude Code,
then enqueues it on ``_result_queue`` for the engine's control loop.
:class:`CrashLoop` signals that the supervisor has exhausted its
crash-recovery budget — the OS-level supervisor (systemd, docker
restart-policy) is expected to restart the whole process.
